# Project Name: Snake Eyes

## Team Members: Kyle Reinholt, Gabriella Johnson

### CSCI5448-001, CSCI5448-001B

- **Project Overview**:
This project, Snake Eyes, adapted the classic Snake game to be utilized with multiple input methods: keyboard, touch, speech, eye gaze, and mouse in an attempt to make it accessible for people with varying physical and cognitive disabilities.

- **Files in Repo**: This repo contains C# classes, game images, and the necessary properties and packages to run the code.


- **Execution Notes**: To run the code, run the file SnakeV1.sln
However, this code will not run unless you have the Tobii Eye Tracker driver downloaded onto your machine because of our eye gaze input method. The demostration of this project will be documented with a video.
